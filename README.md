bananagrams
===========

This is a project I started to try and make the world's best Bananagrams cheat engine.

Contrary to sites that claim to be Bananagrams cheat engines, this app is built specifically for the game and includes the actual board and looks for words you can connect to letters on the board. You can technically play the an entire round of Banagrams without arranging your tiles in the real world.

There are still a few things on the feature list that haven't been started because I'm trying to tackle the logic behind finding connecting words still. It works for a few situations right now but needs lots of bugfixes.

I'll update this README as progress is made.
